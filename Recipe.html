        <p>Chai is a traditional spiced tea originating from India. It is typically made by brewing strong black tea leaves with a blend of aromatic spices, sweeteners, and milk. Common spices include cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black pepper, though the specific mix can vary by region or personal preference. The tea is often served hot and sweetened with sugar or honey, creating a rich, flavorful, and comforting beverage. Chai has become popular worldwide, often enjoyed in cafes and homes alike for its warming qualities and complex taste. In Western cultures, "chai" often refers to what is commonly called "masala chai" in India, which incorporates the spice blend.
